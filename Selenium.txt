Selenium:
What is Selenium:
----------------
>It is Tool Which is dedicated for Web application testing
>It is Functional Testing Tool.
>It is best suited for Regression Testing
>Free
>Open Source: Source code is available on internet
>It is Platform independant (It Supports Multiple OS Linux, MAC, Windows)
>It Supports Multiple Browsers i.e Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE browser etc.
>It Supports Multiple Programming Language i.e Java, C#, ruby, Python etc.

Type of Application:
1.Console Based  which used CMD
2.Desktop Based Application: Which needs installation on Every System
3.Web Application : Application Which needs url(like http://google.com) & they are 		    developed using HTML
4.Mobile Application: That Needs installation in Every Mobile


Selenium Suite:
--------------
1.Selenium IDE
	>It is available as Firefox & Chrome Plug-in
	>It Supports Record(It automatically Writes Script) & PlayBack(For Playing/Executing recorded 	Script)
	>It is Good Tool for Person who is wishing to start with Automation Testing 
	>Easy to Learn & GUI is also Easy

	DisAdvantage:
	1.It Supports only 2 browser (Chrome & Firefox)
	2.It does not Support of Programming Language Hence Code Re-usability is not there Hence It is
	not good for Writing Detail Scripts
	3.data base Testing not possible
	4.Proper Sharable report is not generated
	5.Data Reading is not Supported from Excel File
	6.Only 3 Columns are not Sufficient for Detail Testing

2.Selenium RC | Selenium 1.0 (Selenim RC is Outdated since It is Slow)
		Selenium RC was Slow since
		1.RC Server needed as Middle Man in Between Eclipse & Browser
                  which adds a delay in execution
		2.RC Server needed to be Started & Stopped EveryTime Manually
                  which also adds delay
	
3.Selenium WebDriver | Selenium 2.0 |Selenium 3.0 |Selenium 4.0
	>Both Supports Multiple Browser testing (like Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE etc.)
	>Both Supports Multiple Programming Language i.e Java, ruby, Python, etc.
	>Both Are Test Designing(Writing Script) + Test Execution Tool.
	But Selenim RC is Outdated since It was Slow & WebDriver is Fast

	Till Selenium WebDriver Only One System is Sufficient	

4.Selenium Grid:
	>In this multiple Systems are involve. One Master System(HUB) & Multiple Slave system(Node) 	are involve.
	>Test Execution will be Controlled from Master System
	>It is used for various Browser & OS combination like Firefox on MAc, Firefox on Windows, 	Firefox on Linux etc.
	>With the help of Paralle; Testing Execution time is minimized (In Less Time More Execution 	happens)
	>It is Just Test Execution (Test Scripts are written in the WebDriver Only)
	>Here, Multiple Machine + Multiple Browser Testing Happens.
	 


Writing Test Case Means you did planning for Testing

Planned Test case > Test Script (So that Tool can understand It)
Like Selenium understand Java so your Test cases should be converted into 
Language of tool so that tool can underStand What you have given instruction

System configuration needed for selenium webdriver:
1.JDK
2.Eclipse
3.Selenium language binder
      selenium library available for java,ruby,python
      selenium java libraries are needed 
4.Drivers for every browser is needed
           chrome>chromedriver.exe
           firefox>geckodriver.exe

The path to the driver executable must be set by the webdriver.chrome.driver system property

Element locators:

These are Unique peoperties by which selenium is able to identify/find object on web page
1.id
2.name
3.linkText
4.css
5.Xpath

synchronization problem::
in this there is mismatch between speed of two things
1.selenium
2.AUT(OrangeHRM)

Whwn to automation:
1.There is re usable & repitable test case
   -smoke testing
   -data driven testing:
       it is process in which we repeat same steps with different set of data.
   -compatibility testing
       running same test case with different browser

Why to do automation:
-speed is more
-accuracy is more
-less human errors
-night time also can be utilized
-reliable
-consistent



what is css:
it is used for controlling font,ssize,allignment,color etc
css atttributes/properties also can be used for locating object

1.css with id
   tagname#id
2.css with name/type/value/placeholder/anyproperty
   tagname[name/type/value/placeholder/anyproperty='value of that property]
3.css with classname
tagname.className

-------------------------------------------------
working with radio button:

Thread.sleep()>not recommended
you should use implicit or explicit wait given by selenium

implicit wait:
>implicit wait decalred once at begning & after that it is applicable for all below objects
>it only waits for visiblity of object     
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(15));//wait max 15 nsec
Explicit Wait:
>it is used multiple times for multiple condition/object
>here we explicitly give some condition or ask webdriver to wait
>it can wait on various conditions like visiblity ,invisibility,alert,frame,title etc.

both takes only desired time for waiting

iframe:
always starts with tag as 'iframe' & it is used to show content from multiple website /pages

Task:
open Rediff.com
search 'YesBank ltd' in Enter Company or MF field
search
switch to second tab & print title  & close it.
=>
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C:\\Users\\Bhajan\\Desktop\\SelJars\\chromedriver_win32\\chromedriver.exe");
        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
        driver.get("https://www.rediff.com/");
        driver.switchTo().frame("moneyiframe"); // Using through id or name
 
        driver.findElement(By.name("query")).sendKeys("YES BANK LTD");
        driver.findElement(By.name("query")).sendKeys(Keys.ENTER);
        Set<String> allWin=driver.getWindowHandles();  // It will get All Windows ID
        List<String> allID = new ArrayList<>(allWin); // Convering Set into String
 
        driver.switchTo().window(allID.get(1));  // Switching to Second Window
        System.out.println(driver.getTitle());   // Printing title 
        driver.close();    //Closing the Highlighted Tab
 
        Thread.sleep(2000);
        driver.switchTo().window(allID.get(0));  //Switching to Parent Win
        System.out.println(driver.getTitle());   //Printing title of Parent Window
        driver.quit();   //Closing Main Window
    }
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
webdriver is interface> only method names are present & no body of method is present
chromedriver is a class which implements webdriver 
chrome driver is child of javascripexecuter & takesScreenshot(Parent)
Parent p=new child approach hides child specific method(extra functions gets ide here & only common method is visible)

ata driven testing:
       it is process in which we repeat same steps with different set of data.
  e.g. daily 100 sms is li,it & on 101th error is expected
then you need to send 100 sms & 101th error is expected

performing same thing with different set of data is called as data driven testing

test script                                     data-source
test script                  apache POI          excel(.net)
test script                  <jdbc>                    database
test script                                      dataprovider of testNG


next step is download apache poi since our data will be stored mostly in excel

Apache POI supports both extension of excel file .xls & .xlsx
read workbook>read worksheet>read cells(row,column)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TestNg:
it is framework(set of rules for having good outcome)

Test automation framework:
-reusable classes and methods and object repository

Adv:
1.loc woill be less
2.it creates reusable classes which can be used at multiple places
3.it hides complexity of progeamme and gives easy method for calling

types of framework:
1.user defined
     1.data driven framework
     2.keyword driven framework
     3.hybrid(combination of two or more framework)
2.predefines framework
     1.testng
     2.junit
     3.cucumber

Test Ng:(ng means next generation)
-by default webdriver do not have mechanism for generating 
any reports . so testng gives power of generating reports.
-similar to testng we have Junit.advantages of testng over junit are:
 adv testNg:
1.parallel testing:(same can be executed simultaneously with two 
or more browser or two or more instance of same browser can be created)
2.Parallel testing is not avalable in Junit.
3.test suite (collection of multiple test classes) can be created easily & classes 
from different package also can be included.
But in case of Junit Classes from other package can not be included 
in Test Suite.
4.meaningful annotation name is given.


@dataprovider is used for storing data used for testing internally
 in testng class itself


link data provider with excel file copy the data from excel and store 
data provider then do datadriventesting 


==============================================================================================
JUNIT:



===============================================
page object model:
number of java classes should be equals to number of 
pages available on website/application
keep all objects property at top & respective actions/steps at the bottom
wht(adv):
1.easy to trace
2.easy to change
3.easy to maintain
4.since re usable methods are made we can call those methods at any time


Factory:
Page object is not officially announced by selenium but page factory is 
officially given by selenium

Elements|object repository:
it is single place where we keep all object property like xpath,css,name,linkText
id etc so that tomorrow if any objects property is changed thren tester should feel
easiness while doing changes(if tester does changes at one place then it should 
reflect at all  other places where it has been used

=============================================================================================
What is MAVEN?
>it is build management tool(combination of all classes into singlr unit)(create,update,edit build)
>project management tool
   since it gives template/architect to your project hence it will be consider
    as project management tool
>it manages all jars which is needed to your project
      -selenium
      -apache poi
      -testng
      -junit
      -extent report(enhance reporting ability

Extent Report:
To enhance reporting capability of selenium extent report is used

KeyWordDriven Framework:
It is framework in which reusable actions/keywords ARE created for every step/Actions that you
 perform on browser.This is created by sr. automation tester for easiness in 
automation testing

In background for every keyword corresponding methods/functions are created.
